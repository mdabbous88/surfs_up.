The two queries that could be added to help in further analysis is to analyze the data in the first quartile. This will help to understand the spread of the data in the first quartile and how close from the minimum temperature it is. In the analysis done to both, the dec and june temperatures first quartiles, it shows that both data in the first quartile are far from the minimum temperature recorded and closer to the maximum. This gives us an idea that the cooler days are very few and it asserts that Oahu is a good place for surfing and selling ice cream.
